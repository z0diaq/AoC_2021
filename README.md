# AoC_2021
Advent of Code 2021

my C++ solutions for puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/2021

more for practicing features from latest standards (i.e. modules from C++20, std algorithms and boost) than providing fastest/simplest possible solutions - readability over performance

Code comments and solutions improvements are welcomed!
