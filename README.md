# AoC_2021
Advent of Code 2021

my solutions for @https://adventofcode.com (only 2021 for now) using C++

more for praciticing features from latest standards (i.e. modules from C++20 and boost) than providing fastest/simplest possible solution - readability over performance

Comments on code are welcomed!
